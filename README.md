# Get started with ReactSelector
 with this minimal app

### There are just a few steps to get you up and running

- You will need to have `nodejs` and `npm` already installed. Follow instructions at https://nodejs.org/
- TODO - update this readme for ReactSelector
-


- Clone the project:
  `git clone https://github.com/rohanthewiz/react-selector.git`
- Change to the *project root*: `cd react-selector`
- Install project dependencies:  `npm install`
- Install browserify  `npm install -g browserify`
- You can watch for changed files or manually build.
    - To automatically build when files change:
        - Open another terminal and change directory to the project root
        - Run `npm run watch`
    - To manually build: `npm run build`
- Start the server: `npm start`
- View the output in your browser by navigating to `localhost:8081` (CTRL-C to exit the server)

You are set!
